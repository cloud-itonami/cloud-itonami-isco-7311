# cloud-itonami-isco-7311

Open Occupation Blueprint for **ISCO-08 7311**: Precision-instrument Makers and Repairers.

This repository designs a forkable OSS business for a precision-instrument workshop scheduling and logistics coordination practice: a workshop scheduling and supply-coordination robot manages crew/task records under a governor-gated actor, so a precision-instrument-making crew keeps its own operating records instead of renting a closed workforce-management SaaS.

**Maturity: `:implemented`.** `src/instrumentmaker/` implements the
`InstrumentMakerActor` as a `langgraph.graph/state-graph`
(`instrumentmaker.actor`) wired to an `Instrument Maker Advisor`
(`instrumentmaker.advisor`) and an independent `InstrumentMakerGovernor`
(`instrumentmaker.governor`), following the itonami actor pattern
(ADR-2607121000): `:intake -> :advise -> :govern -> :decide -+-> :commit
(:ok?) +-> :request-approval (:escalate?, human-in-the-loop interrupt)
+-> :hold (:hard?)`. 22 tests / 47 assertions green (`kbb -M:test`).
HARD invariants (always hold, never overridable):
worker provenance, workshop provenance, no-actuation (`:effect` must
be `:propose`), a closed op-allowlist (`:log-work-record`,
`:schedule-crew-operation`, `:flag-safety-concern`,
`:coordinate-supply-order` — nothing else may ever be proposed), and a
permanent, unconditional block on any proposal that would directly
finalize an instrument-repair/calibration-execution decision (e.g.
deciding to proceed with a specific instrument-repair or calibration
procedure) or override a workshop safety officer's judgment. Always-escalate paths (human sign-off regardless
of confidence, mapping this repo's Trust Controls in
[`docs/business-model.md`](docs/business-model.md)):
`:flag-safety-concern` (always) and `:coordinate-supply-order` above
the registered cost threshold.

## Robotics premise

All cloud-itonami verticals are designed on the premise that a **robot performs
the physical domain work**. Here a workshop scheduling/logistics coordination robot performs crew scheduling, task/materials-usage/progress-record logging and precision-parts/materials supply-order coordination for a precision-instrument-making crew, under an actor that proposes actions and an independent **Instrument Maker Governor** that gates them. The governor never
dispatches hardware itself, never performs instrument-repair or calibration work on the shop floor, and never finalizes an instrument-repair/calibration-execution decision or overrides a workshop safety officer's judgment; `:high`/`:safety-critical` actions (such as a flagged eye-strain/hand-injury/solder- or chemical-exposure concern, or an above-threshold supply order) require human sign-off. **This actor coordinates workshop scheduling/logistics only — it never performs instrument-repair or calibration work itself.**

## Core Contract

```text
crew roster + workshop registration + safety-reporting policy
        |
        v
Instrument Maker Advisor -> Instrument Maker Governor -> log/schedule/coordinate, or human sign-off
        |
        v
robot actions (gated) + operating records + audit ledger
```

No automated advice can dispatch a robot action the governor refuses, finalize
an instrument-repair/calibration-execution decision, override a workshop safety officer's judgment, suppress an operating record, or disclose sensitive data without governor
approval and audit evidence.
